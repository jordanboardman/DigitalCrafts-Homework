# 7. Looping from 1 to 10
# Using a while loop, print out the numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive, one on a line. Example output:

# $ python3 1_to_10.py
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10

i = 1
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# I figured this one out with the help of W3 Schools. Maybe I should re-do loops like this from memory everyday or so?
