# 2. HELLO YOU!
# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)

# Example session:

# $ python3 hello2.py
# WHAT IS YOUR NAME? Alice
# HELLO, ALICE!
# YOUR NAME HAS 5 LETTERS IN IT! AWESOME!

name = input('WHAT IS YOUR NAME? ')

print("HELLO,",(name.upper()),"!")
print("YOUR NAME HAS",(len(name)),"LETTERS IN IT! AWESOME!")

#

print('Hello world')
