# Write a program to check if the given number is a palindrome number.
# A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 545, is the palindrome numbers

# userNum = (input('Please type in a palindrome number: '))
# reversedInput = (userNum[::-1])

# # for x in userNum:
# if userNum == reversedInput:
#     print('%s is a palindrome' % userNum)
# else:
#     print('%s is not a palindrome' % userNum)

# try:
#     checkInt = int(numbers)
#     if len(numbers) > 2:
#         palindrome = numbers[::-1]
#         if numbers == palindrome:
#             print('The number %s is a palindrome!' % numbers)

# Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

# For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

# For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

# For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

# for x in range(1, 101):
# #     if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
# #         print('FizzBuzz')
# #     elif x % 3 == 0:
# #         print('Fizz')
# #     elif x % 5 == 0:
# #         print('Buzz')
# #     else: 
#         # print(x)
