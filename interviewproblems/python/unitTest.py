# You ask one of your developers to write a code that will give you the area of a circle. The code the developer writes for you is listed below. Write unit tests to test the following criteria:
# * Test area when radius is >= 0
# * Test that value errors are raised when necessary
# * Test that type errors are raised when necessary
# * Once you have completed the above steps, edit the code below to correct any errors that might occur. 

import math 
import unittest

pi = math.pi

def area_circle(radius):
     return pi*(radius**2)

print(area_circle(10))
